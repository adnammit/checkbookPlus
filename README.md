## OVERVIEW:

A simple checkbook to keep note of your transactions. Written with React.

CheckbookPlus is an improvement over the original Checkbook in that it introduces webpack and node and has been updated to use ES6 standards.


## TO START:
`npm start` will use the "start" script in the `package.json` file.


## TO DO:
* Add a persistent back end
* Clean up webpack config and deploy on a hosted web server
* Add images (like 'X' for transaction removal)
