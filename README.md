## OVERVIEW:

A simple checkbook to keep note of your transactions. Written with React.

CheckbookPlus is an improvement over the original Checkbook in that it introduces webpack and node and has been updated to use ES6 standards.


## TO START:
`npm run dev` to hotload while developing
`npm run build` to transpile deployment to /dist dir


## TO DO:
* format money better
* add form validation
* replace "Add" button with "+" and "-" to easily create debits/credits
* Add a persistent back end
* Clean up webpack config and deploy on a hosted web server
* Add images (like 'X' for transaction removal)
* re-write css
